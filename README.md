# Palm
The repository containing all the code used for the palm detection and counting project.

The files palm_detection.py and palm_detection_large.py are python scripts for training the network on small and large patches we labeled, respectively. The slurm files are used to submit jobs to the DEAC cluster.

The folder `Tools' contains some python scripts that help with processing the palm data and producing desired outputs.
